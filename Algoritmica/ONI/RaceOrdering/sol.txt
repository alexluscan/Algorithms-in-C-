Although there may be up to 30 contestants in total, there are at most 16 in any component of the dependency graph. 
The algorithm may be applied separately to each component. If components with sizes M1 and M2 can be ordered in C1 and C2 ways respectively, 
then their union can be ordered in C1 * C2 * Comb(M1 + M2, M1) different ways.
